   * Netty maintains its own buffer that is fed by the given publisher.
   * This means that data is more likely ready to send as soon as the client receives it.
   * <p>
   * If your data source produces a small amount of data that is expensive to produce (i.e. there is a significant latency between a data request and the production of data)
   * you may want to consider an intermediate buffer to maximize throughput to the client.
